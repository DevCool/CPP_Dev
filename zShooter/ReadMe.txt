Made multiple zombies in an array, body cleanup. Fixed the screen
mask where you would get 20 health and below. It would stay like
that for ever even if you collected a heart. Now it works as in-
tended. Soon if I don't decide to work on something else. I'll
end up making more features like multiplayer or something.

Will compile in Windows and Linux. For linux just grab the SDL
and SDL_mixer libraries, depending your linux it may or may not
have libgl1 headers. You'll need OpenGL and GLU (the extensions
library).

Compiling on Windows, just grab CodeBlocks. From codeblocks.org,
then SDL and SDL_mixer from libsdl.org. Run the codeblocks project.
Then compile.

Both Linux and Windows compiling should have little to no problems
compiling either one.
